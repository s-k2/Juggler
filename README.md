# Juggler
Juggler is aimed to be an PDF-Editor which is based on MuPDF! Currently you can do those things:
* Export all images
* Examine the PDF's structure
* Add pages from another PDF
* Remove pages
* Rotate pages
* Impose pages on sheets

## Build
1. Copy the MuPDF-sources into the mupdf-folder and build it
2. Run Juggler's makefile
3. Run the executable in the bin-directory

## TODO
A lot of work needs to be done as I wrote this program just for my own usage...
